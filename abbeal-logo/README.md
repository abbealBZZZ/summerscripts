## Description

A little coding exercise for the summer.

## Goal

Draw the Abbeal logo in ASCII art with a given character and a given width.

## Resources

### Abbeal Logo

![Abbeal Logo](abbeal_logo.png)

## Rules

Write a method to output the Abbeal logo (2 eyes and 3 stripes) in the console.

It must take as parameters:
- the character to use to draw the logo
- the width of the logo (minimum 5)

The position of the eyes is free but they must not touch each other and the logo must be vertically symmetrical.

You are free to use any language you like.

## Examples

For a width of 8 and the character "x", the result could be:
```
  x  x  
xxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxx
```

For a width of 12 and the character "o", the result could be:
```
   o    o  
oooooooooooo
oooooooooooo
oooooooooooo
```

## To go further...

If this exercise is too easy for you, try to solve it in the least number of characters!

Or if you are more on the creative side, try to keep the proportions of the result as close as possible to the original logo when the width increases!
