# Summerscript: Beehive in ASCII art

## Description

A coding exercise for the summer.

## Goal

Draw a beehive in ASCII art with a given number of cells.

## Rules

A beehive is composed of hexagonal cells, represented like this in ASCII art:

```
  xxxxx      
 x     x    
x       x
 x     x
  xxxxx
```

Given a number of cells, draw the corresponding beehive in ASCII art using the least possible number of "x".

You are free to use any language you like.

## Example

With 4 cells, the result is:

```
        xxxxx
       x     x
  xxxxx       xxxxx
 x     x     x     x
x       xxxxx       x
 x     x     x     x
  xxxxx       xxxxx
       x     x
        xxxxx
```

With 5 cells, the result can be:

```
        xxxxx
       x     x
  xxxxx       xxxxx
 x     x     x     x
x       xxxxx       x
 x     x     x     x
  xxxxx       xxxxx
       x     x     x
        xxxxx       x
             x     x
              xxxxx
```

## To go further...

If this exercise is too easy for you, try to solve it in the least number of characters!

Or if you are more on the creative side, use any number of "x" and try to draw orginal structures when the number of cells increases!
