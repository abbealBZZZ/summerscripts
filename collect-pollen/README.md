# Summerscript: Collect pollen

## Description

A coding exercise for the summer.

## Goal

Find the shortest path to the hive visiting all the flowers.

## Rules

A bee (B) on a 10x10 2D grid wants to collect pollen from all the flowers (f) before returning to its hive (H). Empty cells are represented with a dot (.).

```
B....f....
...f......
.f....f...
.f.......H
```

The bee can go left, right, up and down.

Output the number of moves and the list of moves to go the hive and collect all the pollen using the shortest path possible.

You are free to use any language you like.

## To go further...

First make sure your algorithm works with any 10x10 grid with the same bee and hive position. Each of the other cells could be filled with a flower or not.

Then try to make it work for square grids of bigger sizes in the least amount of time possible.

And then you can try to make it work with any bee and hive position!
